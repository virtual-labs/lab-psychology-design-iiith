  "introduction": "The Psychological Process Lab is a virtual simulation lab designed to help students understand and explore core concepts of attention, perception, and memory through hands-on digital experiments. With applications in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), this lab allows users to experience cognitive phenomena such as the Stroop effect, Simon effect, and color blindness, providing insights into human behavior, interface design, and usability engineering.",
